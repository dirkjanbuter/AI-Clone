# AI-Clone

## How to create your own AI clone
It started as an experiment; I wanted to build a chatbot from scratch. The main goal was not so much the chatbot itself, but more to gain knowledge. Soon the idea went from an AI experiment to a project with a real purpose and application. The goal was to create an AI clone that can train itself and in turn teach me new things and assist me in my daily life and work.

This year we are going to create an AI clone and you can follow this process and help too. I've been at it for a while and now have a pretty good overview of how it works. That is why I can now make a good estimate for a step-by-step plan. In addition to the step-by-step plan, I will share every line of code with you. Do you have no experience with programming or AI? Don't worry, we're in this together, and I could really use your help in another area. So, can you join this project? It will certainly be fun and certainly very educational.
